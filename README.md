# Nutriconv_SegReg
This repository contains the codes and trained models related to the research presented as the Master's Thesis for the Nutriconv titled "Investigation on Nutriconv" for the Research Master's in Artificial Intelligence from AEPIA. If you encounter any issues with the materials, please don't hesitate to reach out to enoljunquera@gmail.com.

Files:
- `tensorflow25.yaml` is an Anaconda Navigator environment with the loaded libraries for the task.
- `Pancake.zip` should be extracted in the same folder as the code, and it contains the pancake dataset generated for this research.
- `ClasReg.py` and `SegReg.py` are the Python scripts prepared for training Regression and Segmentation+Regression models, respectively. They can be run from tensorflow25 environment.
- `HyperparamMulticlass.txt` is a file from which the scripts read the appropriate hyperparameters for their execution.
- `Models.zip` contains the trained models for the current experiment, along with a set of scripts to obtain the results and the graphs included in the research. Due to size limitations, it was not possible to attach them to the GitHub repository, but you can download them from this [LINK](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/gl91qdgohempktvf12e5w/Modelos.zip?rlkey=xw9xihptlgxdswdr5ta8dqg2d&dl=0).
